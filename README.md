# testing-for-aws

This is a sample my simple project for testing various service at AWS, like EC2, RDS and S3 Bucket. 

## S3 Bucket

for S3 Bucket, i get a image from client with multer and store them to my local. Then, i will upload it to my s3. Then, i'm gonna delete 
image which is was on my local (to avoid over capacity in server), and store a path from s3 to my database
